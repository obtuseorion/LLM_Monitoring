The provided python code is the answer to a coding question, generate the python coding question which would best fit the code. There is no need to mention any techniques used in the code. The form and format should be very similar to the following questions:

Write a python function to count the number of positive numbers in a list.

Write a function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.

Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones.

Think through the code in a reasoned step-by-step manner. Come up with a single sentence which would produce the code. 
Now with that question, look through the code again and note anything that violates the logic of the question. Add this accomodation to the coding question.

Once you do so give your answer in the following form:

ANSWER:[the coding question]

The question should be 2 sentences max. Aim for the level of detail in the examples provided.
